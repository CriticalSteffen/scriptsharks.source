> "Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living. If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner." ~[Omar Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Bradley), _Armistice Day Speech_, 1948

# The Personal Computer Revolution

In the early 1970s, computer manufacturers felt that the personal-use "microcomputer" market was too small to be profitable. Microprocessors were invented by Intel in 1971, but without hardware suppliers, computer enthusiasts had no way to put the chips to use. In 1974, [Ed Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Roberts_(computer_engineer)) and his company, [MITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Instrumentation_and_Telemetry_Systems), developed the first commercially-successful microcomputer, the [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800), which was featured on the January 1975 cover of _Popular Electronics_ magazine. The computer was sold as a kit for $397 (about $2,133 in 2022), and though it required significant technical knowledge (and did not ship pre-assembled), the kit sold thousands of orders in the first few weeks, sparking the first flames of the Personal Computer (PC) revolution.

The first mass-produced PCs came in 1977 with the release of the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_family), Commodore's [PET 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PET_2001) and Tandy's [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80), deemed the "1977 Trinity." With relatively simple programming languages and budget-friendly price-points, these systems significantly lowered the barrier to entry for computer technology. What had once been the purview of Governments, Corporations and Universities was now in the hands of a booming population of hobbyists, who turned their hobby into a booming new industry practically overnight. 

In the 1980s, as Bill Gates envisioned "a computer on every desk and in every home," the ever-greater ubiquity of PCs led to a malware renaissance; what had once been simple experiments and pranks evolved into wide-spread, destructive attacks. Pandora's Box had been opened, and could not be closed again.
