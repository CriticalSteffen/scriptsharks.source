# Dawn of an Age

Long ago, when people wanted to count things, they had to use their fingers. For bigger numbers, they had to use their toes, too, or even borrow the fingers and toes of their neighbors. But this was untenable, so people started carving tallies into sticks and bones. In 2400 BCE, the Babylonians invented what would become the abacus. Around 100 BCE, the [Antikythera Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism), the oldest example of an analogue computer, was used to predict astronomical events. These humble beginnings triggered humanity's undying hunger for technological advancement, which became the guiding principle behind the current "smart everything" era.

In their defense, those ancient inventors couldn't have predicted ransomware when they were pushing beads about strings and building tools to track the stars.

# Yes, _That_ von Neumann

In 1949, [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) gave a series of lectures about the "Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata," which became the basis for his ["Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata"](http://cba.mit.edu/events/03.11.ASE/docs/VonNeumann.pdf), published in 1966. During his lifetime, von Neumann wrote over 150 papers about mathematics, physics and computing, contributed to the [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project) during World War II, and promoted the policy of [mutually assured destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) to deter the nuclear arms race.

In retrospect, von Neumann's 1966 article may seem one of his less-notable achievements. Yet this paper contributed directly to the invention of the earliest examples of malicious software (the term "malware" wasn't coined until the '90s, over 20 years following von Neumann's paper).

# Creeper and Reaper

In 1971, Bob Thomas wrote [Creeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_(program)), a program designed to test the ideas proposed by von Neumann's article. Creeper migrated across [PDP-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10) mainframes running [TENEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TENEX_(operating_system)) which were connected to [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET). Systems infected by Creeper would show the message "I'M THE CREEPER; CATCH ME IF YOU CAN" before the malware jumped to a different system on the network.

A second variant of Creeper produced by Ray Tomlinson was altered so that instead of moving itself between systems, it would duplicate itself across systems, thus becoming the world's first computer worm. Recognizing the evil he had brought into the world, Tomlinson attempted to re-balance his karmic scales by producing [Reaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaper_(program)), a program designed to seek out and destroy the Creeper worm.

Unfortunately, Reaper functioned much like Creeper, spreading across PDP-10s on ARPANET. Thus, despite being the world's first anti-virus software, it also became the world's second computer worm, and the first example of software fratricide.

Like Cain slaying Abel, the conflict between Reaper and Creeper set the stage for the present-day digital arms race, pitting malware authors against antivirus engineers in a never-ending battle for supremacy.

Speaking of battles for digital supremacy, Creeper and Reaper also inspired the creation of [Core War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War) in 1984, a computer programming game wherein software "warriors" fight for dominance in a virtual computer. Warrior programs were written in "Redcode," a primitive form of Assembly Language designed specifically for the game.

Fictionalized versions of Reaper also featured as antagonists in the Japanese anime TV series [Digimon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon_Tamers). So cool.
