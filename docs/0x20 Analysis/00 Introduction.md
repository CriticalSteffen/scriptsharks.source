# The Flip-Side

As mentioned in the [Design Section](/0x10%20Design/00%20Introduction/), malware researchers and malware authors are two sides of the same coin. In this section, we'll explore the analytic methods, techniques and tools used to examine and understand malware samples, and how to perform such analysis safely. As before, this section is not a tutorial, but a reference. There is no single, "correct" way to analyze malware, and the techniques described here are only a subset of those available. I will expand this section over time, and I hope you will contribute, too!
